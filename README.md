In this homework, I built an application based on the famous Agar.io gameplay scenario.
I was supposed to use object-oriented design principles to build the application, and we also slightly
modify and advance the original game scenario such that the cells are now autonomous, and they
evolve and learn new behavior types as they gain mass.

The goal was to implement a prepared classes and we were allowed to create new ones.
The most challenging part was the fact that I had compulsory 25 classes, and coding one so that it doesn't crashes another needed consideration of many classes in my  mind. 
But on the other hand I was free to add my own functions and even change scenario. I added control on keys for one player.
